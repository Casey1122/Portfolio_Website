                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The initial idea was to prototype a comprehensive tracking app to help. There are tons of similar apps in the market, offering unlimited possibilities. However, some of these features were not supported in Hong Kong, like tracking your bank account or credit card. In such a way, the best way to do that was offering cashing and recurring tracking. </p>
            
                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p>This project aims to tackle the complexity of managing personal expenses, providing a better alternative for everyone who is having problems with budgeting. </p>
                
                <h2>Idea Transformation</h2>
                <p>I have sketched several layouts on paper and illustrated a flow of entering expenses manually. I have done a little bit research of art direction and tried 
                    to include illustrations to style the app interface. 
                    </p>
                <img class="img-style" src="./img/Wallet App Presentation_Idea.png" alt="">

                <h2>Idea 1: Trim down unnecessary information</h2>
                <p>It seems that third party apps can hardly provide automation. Instead of a high level of automation, recurring expenses are added to the app. It is able to solve certain bills or transactions that happen periodically.
                </p>

            
                <h2>Idea 2: Enjoyable Visual Element</h2>
                <p>There is a trend that more apps tend to adapt a cuter style or gamification to make tracking enjoyable. Some of them even provide an achievement function to encourage users’ engagement. Similarly, I tried to provide explanational illustrations and make the app less formal at the same time.</p>

                <h2>Idea 3: Privacy and Synchronization</h2>
                <p>It would be beneficial if an application could synchronize data or even export it to a spreadsheet. Definitely, levering passcode login is almost a standard.</p>

                <img class="img-style" src="./img/Wallet App Presentation_mood.png" alt="">
                <p>Adding some pleasurable elements to the app, making the process less dull and tedious. I look for inspiration from modern silhouette graphics and color palettes which can be applied. Appealing elements give different moods to the users which makes the money tracking process pleasing.</p>
